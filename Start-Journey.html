    <h1> Failsafe and how it works </h1>
    <p> Failsafe is a company built around tackling a very common and serious cognitive bias. The bias we are attempting to tackle is knwon as the zeigarnik effect. The way we intend to tackle the effect is by creating a checklist where people can manage their own tasks and learn self management.<p>
